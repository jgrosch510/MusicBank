There was no encore for this show.  "One More Saturday Night" was played in the second set and was the intended final song for the TV broadcast, which explains why Bob Weir said "Bye, bye" at the end of the song.  The television cameras were not on for the third set.</comment><lastupdate>2012-02-03 14:36:36</lastupdate><showyear>1972</showyear><showsuserid>STLBlues</showsuserid></key_14><key_15><name>Grateful Dead</name><artist_key>2</artist_key><shows_key>763</shows_key><showdate>04/21/72</showdate><venue>Beat Club</venue><city>Bremen</city><state>Germany</state><set1>Bertha
