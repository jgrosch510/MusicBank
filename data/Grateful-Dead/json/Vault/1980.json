Noticeable \r\ndifferences are mainly the presence of more audience between \r\nsome songs, and the mix is a bit different from the final LP. \r\nFifteen tracks were released on a single CD in 1988 (with OBIANL \r\nomitted), then remastered again and expanded for the 2006 double \r\nCD reissue. This sounds quite different from the CD versions",
