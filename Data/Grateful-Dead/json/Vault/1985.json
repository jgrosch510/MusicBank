                    "comment": "NOTES:  The only changes made to the songs are getting them all to one volume level and fades. I did the best I could with fades, but some are rather abrupt due to the fact that one song goes right into the next. Overall I think it turned out good.  You might consider burning this in TAO instead of DAO - I added 1 second of silence at the beginning and end of each song to separate them, but TAO is still the way to go IMHO.\r\n\r\nMy reasoning for deciding which versions to include is listed below:\r\n\r\nDay Tripper   GD 06-25-85  Suggested by David Gans\r\n\r\nCome Together   Dead 07-07-03  Suggested by a fellow CDead member.  He said that he believed that Joan's super hot performance got this one going.\r\n\r\nEleanor Rigby Jam JGB 02-12-80 One of very few.  All are ragged.  Chose this one as one of best.\r\n\r\nTomorrow Never Knows GD 11/29/94 Suggested to me by someone on the CDead group I think.\r\n\r\nBlackbird   Ratdog 11-09-99  One I had.... The two GD versions really sucked\r\n\r\nGet Back   PLQ 10-16-00  Not played much, GD version very poor\r\n\r\nWhy Don't We Do It In The Road   GD  04-07-85  Well, it IS a Beatles song...less lame than the others (I was almost tempted to leave it off entirely)\r\n\r\nHey Jude   GD  03-22-90  *Complete version; Jude>Reprise patched together, dropping \"Dear Mr. Fantasy\" entirelly; There is a slight \"hitch\" between Jude and the Reprise but I left it as is to keep as much music as possible without including \"Fantasy.\"  I had originally thought of using the 3/1/69 version, but David Gans suggested this one as the better choice.  Even though the '69 one has Pigpen, this one is better.\r\n\r\nStrawberry Fields Forever   PLQ 02-08-02  Pretty hot version, although a bit hollow; it also features some interesting hints to Eleanor Rigby.\r\n\r\nRain   GD  10-09-94  I perused The Compendium Volume III and found this to be one of the better versions, which, upon hearing it, it is.\r\n\r\nDISC II\r\n\r\nRevolution   GD  07-02-85  I listened to all of the versions, and this one shone above the rest.  I could have sworn that there was a really good one from '90, but, when I listened, well, I guess I was mistaken.\r\n\r\nShe Said   Dead 07-07-03  Joan smokes on this puppy!\r\n\r\nDear Prudence   Reconstruction 7-8-79  Suggested here as a good version in lieu of the later JGB versions - it has pretty much what he played with the JGB, with horns, and back when he was healthy.\r\n\r\nAll Too Much   GD  03-26-95  Someone here suggested this one.\r\n\r\nI Want To Tell You   JGB 03-08-87  *1 of 2 JGB times played; The '76 version is ragged which is a shame as Donna and Keith were part of the JGB back then.  I to go with a JGB version instead of the GD versions as Jerry was in much better health.  Also, the JGB allowed him to stretch out in a different direction.\r\n\r\nLucy In The Sky With Diamonds    GD  03-17-95  Best version according to The Compendium Volume III.\r\n\r\nI Am The Walrus   PLQ 09-01-02 - personal favorite, I attended and we believed that PLQ was not going to tour anymore....\r\n\r\nWhile My Guitar Gently Weeps   PLQ 11-30-01  Bitter sweet to hear this one as it was the day after George died. It was only played once; I wish they had included this in their repertoire, or at least pulled it out every so often as a surprise. Warren does this one \"just exactly perfect.\"",
