</set1><set2></set2><set3></set3><comment>NOTES:  The only changes made to the songs are getting them all to one volume level and fades. I did the best I could with fades, but some are rather abrupt due to the fact that one song goes right into the next. Overall I think it turned out good.  You might consider burning this in TAO instead of DAO - I added 1 second of silence at the beginning and end of each song to separate them, but TAO is still the way to go IMHO.&#13;
&#13;
My reasoning for deciding which versions to include is listed below:&#13;
&#13;
Day Tripper   GD 06-25-85  Suggested by David Gans&#13;
&#13;
Come Together   Dead 07-07-03  Suggested by a fellow CDead member.  He said that he believed that Joan's super hot performance got this one going.&#13;
&#13;
Eleanor Rigby Jam JGB 02-12-80 One of very few.  All are ragged.  Chose this one as one of best.&#13;
&#13;
Tomorrow Never Knows GD 11/29/94 Suggested to me by someone on the CDead group I think.&#13;
&#13;
Blackbird   Ratdog 11-09-99  One I had.... The two GD versions really sucked&#13;
&#13;
Get Back   PLQ 10-16-00  Not played much, GD version very poor&#13;
&#13;
Why Don't We Do It In The Road   GD  04-07-85  Well, it IS a Beatles song...less lame than the others (I was almost tempted to leave it off entirely)&#13;
&#13;
Hey Jude   GD  03-22-90  *Complete version; Jude&gt;Reprise patched together, dropping "Dear Mr. Fantasy" entirelly; There is a slight "hitch" between Jude and the Reprise but I left it as is to keep as much music as possible without including "Fantasy."  I had originally thought of using the 3/1/69 version, but David Gans suggested this one as the better choice.  Even though the '69 one has Pigpen, this one is better.&#13;
&#13;
Strawberry Fields Forever   PLQ 02-08-02  Pretty hot version, although a bit hollow; it also features some interesting hints to Eleanor Rigby.&#13;
&#13;
Rain   GD  10-09-94  I perused The Compendium Volume III and found this to be one of the better versions, which, upon hearing it, it is.&#13;
&#13;
DISC II&#13;
&#13;
Revolution   GD  07-02-85  I listened to all of the versions, and this one shone above the rest.  I could have sworn that there was a really good one from '90, but, when I listened, well, I guess I was mistaken.&#13;
&#13;
She Said   Dead 07-07-03  Joan smokes on this puppy!&#13;
&#13;
Dear Prudence   Reconstruction 7-8-79  Suggested here as a good version in lieu of the later JGB versions - it has pretty much what he played with the JGB, with horns, and back when he was healthy.&#13;
&#13;
All Too Much   GD  03-26-95  Someone here suggested this one.&#13;
&#13;
I Want To Tell You   JGB 03-08-87  *1 of 2 JGB times played; The '76 version is ragged which is a shame as Donna and Keith were part of the JGB back then.  I to go with a JGB version instead of the GD versions as Jerry was in much better health.  Also, the JGB allowed him to stretch out in a different direction.&#13;
&#13;
Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds    GD  03-17-95  Best version according to The Compendium Volume III.&#13;
&#13;
I Am The Walrus   PLQ 09-01-02 - personal favorite, I attended and we believed that PLQ was not going to tour anymore....&#13;
&#13;
While My Guitar Gently Weeps   PLQ 11-30-01  Bitter sweet to hear this one as it was the day after George died. It was only played once; I wish they had included this in their repertoire, or at least pulled it out every so often as a surprise. Warren does this one "just exactly perfect."</comment><lastupdate>2004-03-12 11:04:15</lastupdate><showyear>1985</showyear><showsuserid>SleepyMonkey</showsuserid></key_73><key_74><name>Grateful Dead</name><artist_key>2</artist_key><shows_key>298139</shows_key><showdate>??/??/85</showdate><venue>20th Anniversary Press Conference</venue><city>Berkeley</city><state>CA</state><set1>the whole band fields questions from the media for 20 minutes</set1><set2></set2><set3></set3><comment></comment><lastupdate>2009-12-09 16:03:35</lastupdate><showyear>1985</showyear><showsuserid>hamilton</showsuserid></key_74><key_75><name>Grateful Dead</name><artist_key>2</artist_key><shows_key>386335</shows_key><showdate>??/??/85</showdate><venue>Various Television Appearances</venue><city>Various</city><state>Various</state><set1>West 57th (CBS) 1985 &#13;
	Very entertaining report on the Grateful Dead 20th &#13;
anniversary shot at the Ventura County Fairgrounds.  This&#13;
one really captures the concert experience.  Lots of dancing,&#13;
drugs, and Deadheads.  The shots of the band on stage are&#13;
really fine...palm trees in the background.  Of all the &#13;
TV specials for my parents to see what the Dead was about,&#13;
I'm sorry they saw this one. Too much information!&#13;
&#13;
KGO TV News (S.F.) 5-85 &#13;
	A couple of quick reports about the San Francisco visit&#13;
by the Gyuto Monks from Tibet.  Interview with Mickey Hart.&#13;
&#13;
KGO TV News (S.F.) 6-85 &#13;
	To mark the 20th anniversary of Grateful Dead, KGO TV&#13;
ran a three-part series on it's local newscast.  Lots of very&#13;
familiar footage,  some New Year's Eve '84, Chinese New Year '85,&#13;
Frost Ampitheater '85 and on the final report some footage from&#13;
earlier in the evening at the Greek Theater in Berkeley.  &#13;
Interview clips with Bob Weir, Mickey Hart, Bill Graham, David Gans&#13;
and others. Early in this series they mention Ron "Pigpen" McKernan, &#13;
while the shot is actually Phil Lesh from the famous film by &#13;
Robert Nelson.&#13;
&#13;
On a sad note, the KGO reports feature Bay Area broadcast giant &#13;
Pete Wilson, who passed away July 20th.&#13;
