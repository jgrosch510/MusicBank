Observations from fan Marty Kasdan: The correct [venue] spelling is (was) the standard: Warehouse.   I was there and still have the flyer from this weekend, which was opening weekend. The Flock opened the first 2 nights, followed by F Mac and then the Dead; they couldn't make the "Bread for the Dead" show so it was F Mac and the Dead only.</comment><lastupdate>2005-10-21 00:00:00</lastupdate><showyear>1970</showyear><showsuserid>hamilton</showsuserid></key_16><key_17><name>Grateful Dead</name><artist_key>2</artist_key><shows_key>534</shows_key><showdate>02/02/70</showdate><venue>The Fabulous Fox Theatre</venue><city>St. Louis</city><state>MO</state><set1>Casey Jones, Mama Tried, Hard To Handle, Cold Rain And Snow, Black Peter, Cumberland Blues, Dark Star &amp;gt; St. Stephen &amp;gt; Mason's Children, Good Lovin', Uncle John's Band, Turn On Your Love Light &amp;gt; Not Fade Away &amp;gt; Turn On Your Lovelight

The 16 minute tape fragment sometimes circulated with this label is actually Fleetwood Mac w/ Peter Green, Clapton &amp; Jr. Wells, Tea Party, Boston 2/12/70, the encore of Fleetwood Mac's set.  Also, the 45 AUD tape excerpt from the 2/13/70 Early Show sometimes circulates mislabeled '2/12/70 Ungano's;' for more on this tape see 2/13/70a."</comment><lastupdate>2004-09-05 15:12:42</lastupdate><showyear>1970</showyear><showsuserid>hamilton</showsuserid></key_26><key_27><name>Grateful Dead</name><artist_key>2</artist_key><shows_key>543</shows_key><showdate>02/13/70</showdate><venue>Fillmore East (Late Show)</venue><city>New York</city><state>NY</state><set1>China Cat Sunflower-&gt; I Know You Rider, Me &amp; My Uncle, Dire Wolf, Smokestack Lightning</set1><set2>Monkey &amp; The Engineer, Little Sadie, Wake Up Little Susie-&gt; Black Peter, Uncle John's Band, Katie Mae</set2><set3>Dark Star-&gt; Cryptical Envelopement-&gt; Drums-&gt; The Other One-&gt; Cryptical Envelopement-&gt; Turn On Your Love Light, E: We Bid You Good Night</set3><comment>Late show.

Fleetwood Mac and Greg &amp; Duane Allman and Peter Green&#13;
&#13;
From a bootleg CD entitiled "The Best Damn Music In The World"&#13;
&#13;
Post Processing&#13;
===============&#13;
&#13;
These shows are soundboards, and sound great. Originally, however,&#13;
2/11/70 suffered from a very low bass mix. I played around with a bunch&#13;
of EQ curves (using Sound Forge 4.5), burned selections with different&#13;
EQ curves to CD-RW, and listened on my good stereo to decide what curve&#13;
to use. 2/2/70 also was low in the bass, less so than 2/11, and I did&#13;
the same to determine what kind of EQ to use.&#13;
&#13;
Secondly, for the 2/1 Lovelight, the right channel would completely&#13;
disappear for anywhere from seconds to handfuls of minutes, which&#13;
obviously sucks. So I mono-ized it where this occurred, pasting the left&#13;
channel to the right where it went away. Much less annoying.&#13;
&#13;
As a side note, I must say that my philosophy is ONLY EQ IF THE&#13;
RECORDING REALLY NEEDS IT. I asked myself, would I enjoy the music as&#13;
it is? The answer was, sortof. My next question was do I enjoy the EQed&#13;
music more? The answer was a resounding YES. I hope you enjoy it too.&#13;
&#13;
There is a bonus track included.  You win absolutely nothing by&#13;
determining where it comes from. I will probably eventually seed the&#13;
entire show from whence it came.&#13;

-Portions of this show were televised on 12-13-70 for a PBS special titled "San Francisco Rock: A Night At The Family Dog".  Jefferson Airplane and Santana were also present.   Hard To Handle &amp; China-&gt;Rider were the only songs broadcasted from the Dead's set.  Deadbase indicates that Cold Rain &amp; Snow, Black Peter, and Me &amp; My Uncle were also played in the Dead's set.   &#13;
&#13;
Notes:&#13;
-The recent C. Miller (autumn 2002) seed provided China Cat through Midnight Hour in crisp quality.  Hard To Handle was missing from that recording, and is added to this set from the mono/TV lineaged source.  &#13;
-Sound Forge was used for minor edits througout&#13;
&#13;

The band's gear was late to the gig, so they had to use the Allman's gear.

"From: David Hollister&#13;
Subject: A show to be heard&#13;
&#13;
Interesting info that makes this show so cool:&#13;
&#13;
During the little drumming interlude prior to the Other One, there is some woman&#13;
you can hear ranting and raving and generally going on about Viet Nam.  It would&#13;
seem the band kind of lets her state her piece in its entirety before going into&#13;
the Other One.  Very cool.&#13;
&#13;
The whole second CD is very cool.  The jam after the Cryptical reprise is&#13;
great.  It goes into a kind of lulling drum beat which goes on for a few minutes&#13;
(what I called Drums again, even though it isn't in the official setlist) before&#13;
Phil takes it up and you hear the definite Main Ten bass line.  A great Main Ten&#13;
jam that goes on for about 4 1/2 minutes or so before Bobby takes it into Sugar&#13;
Magnolia.&#13;
&#13;
First version of Sugar Magnolia.  Very cool  :)  No, it doesn't rock, but up&#13;
until now, the earliest version I'd ever heard was the one from the famed&#13;
6/24/70 Cap Theater show, which I thought was unusual enough to be of historical&#13;
significance.  This one is also interesting historically.&#13;
&#13;
Between Top of the World and Casey Jones the band sits around talking to the&#13;
crowd and deciding what to play next.  What kills me is Bobby's comment: "Hey,&#13;
there's a guy over there, he's always over there and he always yells out 'Golden&#13;
Road!'.  I wanna know who he is, because man, you really take the cake.  To tell&#13;
you the truth we've forgotten how to play that song" or something like that. &#13;
You can also hear several suggestions for songs, among them "White Rabbit",&#13;
which cracks up the crowd.&#13;
&#13;
Great stuff.  Let's get it out there.  The acoustic set is pretty&#13;
straight-forward, but it's the electric set I think that really shines.  The&#13;
boys just seems to be having a great time the whole show."</comment><lastupdate>1996-01-07 00:00:00</lastupdate><showyear>1970</showyear><showsuserid>hamilton</showsuserid></key_78><key_79><name>Grateful Dead</name><artist_key>2</artist_key><shows_key>590</shows_key><showdate>06/10/70</showdate><venue>Diamond Head Crater</venue><city>Oahu</city><state>HI</state><set1>

The Capitol Theater's Village Voice ad for October 1 lists shows ("featurning NRPS") at 8:00 PM on November 5th, 6th, 7th &amp; 8th; there's no further mention of these shows at all in the the Capitol's Voice ads for 10/29 and 11/5, while ads for the shows at the 46th St. Rock Palace in Brooklyn are prominent in these same issues. On Thursday and Sunday the show consisted of an acoustic Dead set, a NRPS set, and an electric Dead set. On Friday and Saturday, they added a second electric Dead set.</comment><lastupdate>2005-10-22 18:48:54</lastupdate><showyear>1970</showyear><showsuserid>system</showsuserid></key_131><key_132><name>Grateful Dead</name><artist_key>2</artist_key><shows_key>639</shows_key><showdate>11/08/70</showdate><venue>Capitol Theater</venue><city>Port Chester</city><state>NY</state><set1>Dire Wolf, I Know You Rider, Dark Hollow, Rosalie McFall, El Paso, Operator, Ripple, Friend Of The Devil, Wake Up Little Susie, Uncle John's Band</set1><set2>Morning Dew, Me &amp; My Uncle, Mystery Train-&gt; My Babe, Around &amp; Around, New Orleans-&gt; Searchin', It's All Over Now Baby Blue, Casey Jones, Truckin'-&gt; Dark Star-&gt; The Main Ten-&gt; Dancin' In The Streets, Not Fade Away-&gt; Goin' Down The Road Feelin' Bad-&gt; Not Fade Away-&gt; Good Lovin'-&gt; Drums-&gt; Good Lovin'</set2><set3>

However, when Dick copied the show to cassette, he attached the following label: "Here is something I have, that was labeled 12/17/70 - Winterland." &#13;
&#13;
A long-standing confusion between this show and the Owsley benefit held at Winterland on 12/23/70, continues to infect GD tapelists. The first four songs, "Hard to Handle" through "Cold Rain and Snow," were put into general circulation by the Bay Area Tapers Group in the mid-1990s, and continue to be mislabeled as 12/23/70. </comment><lastupdate>2007-07-24 22:49:48</lastupdate><showyear>1970</showyear><showsuserid>Grateful Darkstar</showsuserid></key_150><key_151><name>Grateful Dead</name><artist_key>2</artist_key><shows_key>658</shows_key><showdate>12/21/70</showdate><venue>Pepperland</venue><city>San Rafael</city><state>CA</state><set1>

It was preceded by a NRPS set to make up the complete show. The tapes show DeadBase IX to be mistaken in placing a setbreak between Casey Jones and Dire Wolf. The opening few seconds of Big RR are clipped; this version has some novel lyrics. Beat It gets 4 beats.
