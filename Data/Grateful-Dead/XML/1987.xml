This short feature was spawned by the whirlwind of &#13;
publicity the Grateful Dead received in the summer of&#13;
1987. With the new album \"In The Dark\", the surprising&#13;
hit song \"Touch of Grey\" and the MTV video of that song,&#13;
The Boys were on a very big roll. As if these things&#13;
weren\'t enough, they did huge stadium concerts with&#13;
Bob Dylan. Nice interviews, some historic footage, and &#13;
plenty of live concert clips (Frost Amp. 1985 &amp; 1987, and&#13;
very cool Greek Theatre 1981) will hold any Deadhead\'s&#13;
attention. &#13;

was playing Touch of Grey heavily in it's rotation&#13;
at the time.  Many believe this was the beggining of&#13;
the end for the Grateful Dead.&#13;
&#13;
From "Skeleton Key - A Dictionary For Deadheads" -&#13;
The success of "A Touch of Grey" is often cited for&#13;
the influx of younger Heads onto the scene (though&#13;
Steve Marcus believes it was MTV's "Day of the Dead").&#13;
&#13;
"They kept cutting into the parking lot scene at &#13;
Giants Stadium, saying, "Cool, dude, what a party!" &#13;
And a whole shitload of folks came in to party.  &#13;
They didn't even know who the Dead were. You'd see&#13;
a lot of people in leather with metal studs and &#13;
pointed hair,'cause it was "Grateful Dead" - sounds&#13;
like a metal band!  They didn't have a clue.  &#13;
And a lot of the younger ones just didn't have Deadhead&#13;
etiquette.  When I started working for the Dead in 1983,&#13;
the median age group was twenty-seven years old.  &#13;
By late 1987, it was down to about eighteen.  That's &#13;
a hell of a jump.  But it's their band too." - Steve Marcus&#13;
&#13;
Here then, is MTV's "Day of the Dead".  All blatantly&#13;
official segments have been removed.&#13;

&#13;
Here is the most complete version I have come across of &#13;
the "So Far" press conterence held on September 14th, 1987 &#13;
in New York City.  Grateful Dead publicist Dennis McNally&#13;
introduces the panel - Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir, Len Dell'Amico,&#13;
and Clive Davis.  This press conference centers on the video&#13;
project "So Far", but strays into other interesting topics.  &#13;
At one point, when Jerry Garcia is asked "How did things go &#13;
with your sessions with Robert Hunter?", the tape suddenly &#13;
fast forwards and goes to black.  When the video resumes, &#13;
Dennis McNally reminds the press that "So Far is the reason &#13;
we came here today".&#13;
&#13;
I found two very short clips from this event at YouTube, &#13;
which are of much better quality than this, but with the &#13;
upcoming release of "So Far" for the first time on DVD &#13;
(April 2012),I felt that this was a timely upload.  &#13;

&#13;
Arista sent me this promo album along with the ?Touch of Grey? single, the ?My Brother Esau? cassette,  and an ?In The Dark? bumper sticker when I worked at a radio station.  The album cover mimicked ?In The Dark? but it was black and white.  Side one was un-racked for radio play, which I chose to digitize, as the running time is just over twenty minutes and is easily listened to in one sitting. Arista must have been in a hurry,  because Dick Latvala?s name was misspelled as Latuala.</comment><lastupdate>2006-03-05 18:19:54</lastupdate><showyear>1987</showyear><showsuserid>other3</showsuserid></key_98><key_99><name>Grateful Dead</name><artist_key>2</artist_key><shows_key>162132</shows_key><showdate>??/??/87</showdate><venue>Justin Kreutzmann video outtakes</venue><city>Various</city><state>Various</state><set1>Justin Kreutzmann video outtakes 1986-1989&#13;

-This 2 disc movie is comprised of 2 vcd-compliant mpeg-1 files.&#13;
-There was no text file or information included with the original mpegs.&#13;
-I have deduced that this movie contains footage from the following tours:Summer 1987, Fall 1987, Spring 1988, Summer 1988, Fall 1988&#13;
-No director/producer credits provided, by I suspect Justin Kreutzman is the culprit.</comment><lastupdate>2006-02-25 10:15:13</lastupdate><showyear>1987</showyear><showsuserid>2djinn</showsuserid></key_101></shows><status>success</status></fetchArtistYear></db_rest>
